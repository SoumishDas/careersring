# Testing

Automated tests cover the React components using Jest and React Testing Library.

Run the suite with:
```bash
npm test
```

The `__tests__/candidateForm.test.jsx` file verifies form validation logic. Additional tests should be added for the multi-step form and backend handlers.

Go packages currently have no tests but can be tested using the `go test` command. Consider writing unit tests for controllers and model helpers.
