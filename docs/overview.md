# Overview

CareersRing combines a Next.js frontend with a Go API to manage candidate data for recruitment workflows. The repository is organized into two main parts:

1. `src/` – the Next.js application containing pages, components and forms.
2. `api/` – a Go module exposing REST endpoints using the Gin framework.

Scripts in the `scripts/` directory help with local development, building for production and deploying as a systemd service.
